# Urban Greenspace Management System

## About
Urban green spaces and public parks are vital to environmental sustainability, providing air quality improvements, habitats for wildlife, and food sources. They contribute significantly to the environmental, physical, and mental well-being of surrounding communities. This project aims to implement a system to protect and manage these crucial green spaces, ensuring they are preserved and maintained effectively.

## Objectives
The project applies concepts of distributed cloud computing to optimize maintenance operations. By scheduling maintenance and watering based on weather forecasts and seasonal needs, the system aims to optimize resources, reduce water waste, and ensure timely and effective maintenance of green spaces.

## Implementation Details
The system features two views: one for users to report issues and another for park managers to review issues and schedule maintenance and watering, implemented with a frontend using JS, HTML, and CSS, and a backend powered by Python and a FastAPI server.
